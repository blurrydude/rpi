          <p class="lead text-muted">The purpose of this site is to showcase my various skills through my personal projects. Many of the professional applications I've built or worked on cannot be displayed for legal reasons. This is also true for most of the ghostwriting I've done; however, there are plenty of samples to demonstrate my style and ability.</p>
          <p class="lead text-muted">In the coding area of this site, I will include fully-functional web applcations that are publicly accessible as well as source examples for those who'd like to delve deeper into my actual code.</p>
          <p class="lead text-muted">I am also including some other projects that I work on from time to time. These are usually projects to improve my home or create something unique for a friend or family member.</p>

          <h1>Side Projects</h1>
          <p class="lead text-justify">&nbsp; I try not to take on too much at a time, but I've done a great deal of tinkering over the years--and I still have some projects in the works.<br>&nbsp; One such project, still being worked on, is the conversion of my new house's 1950's low-voltage lighting system (not what it sounds like). There are some projects that have been completed from an engineering standpoint, but continue to operate and improve my life or the life of others.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;For instance, I run several ASIC-based cryptocurrency miners, but there's a twist. I also heat my home for free and pay a significant portion of my other utilities this way (with admittedly mixed results and reactions).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;I am a huge fan of automation and IoT, and therefore, I am always doing things with my Raspberry Pi microcomputers such as programmable LED lighting or controlling my telescope and viewing it remotely on chilly nights.<br>&nbsp; I grew up in a family of carpenters and craftsmen, so naturally I do quite a bit of woodworking--and where possible, I combine my skills to make unique things for people--sometimes by request, sometimes on a whim.<br>&nbsp; I will eventually gather up all the various writings I've done for these projects, edit them, and put them on this site, but please feel free to ask about anything from carputers, programmable coffins, and immersion cooling cryptocurrency miners to self-maneuvering kayaks, wood turning, and building Ares' throne.</p>
